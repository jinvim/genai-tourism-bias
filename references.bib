Building on their work, this paper offers a conceptual critique that addresses underexamined theoretical, ethical, and epistemological concerns, including algorithmic accountability, digital inequality, data pollution, and cultural misrepresentation. It warns of the risks of reinforcing dominant narratives and excluding marginalized voices. In response, the Responsible Synthetic Data Usage in Tourism (RSDU-T) framework is proposed, structured around four pillars: transparency, methodological rigor, ethical reflexivity, and epistemological integrity. The framework provides actionable guidelines and is supported by real-world illustrations and a stakeholder implications table to ensure practical relevance. It calls for a reflexive, inclusive, and culturally grounded approach to responsibly integrate synthetic data into tourism research.}

  abstract = {Large language-model chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek are quickly gaining traction as an easy, first-stop tool for trip planning because they offer instant, conversational advice that once required sifting through multiple websites or guidebooks. Yet little is known about the biases that shape the destination suggestions these systems provide. This study conducts a controlled, persona-based audit of the two models, generating 6480 recommendations for 216 traveller profiles that vary by origin country, age, gender identity and trip theme. Six observable bias families (popularity, geographic, cultural, stereotype, demographic and reinforcement) are quantified using tourism rankings, Hofstede scores, a 150-term cliché lexicon and information-theoretic distance measures. Findings reveal measurable bias in every bias category. DeepSeek is more likely than ChatGPT to suggest off-list cities and recommends domestic travel more often, while both models still favour mainstream destinations. DeepSeek also points users toward culturally more distant destinations on all six Hofstede dimensions and employs a denser, superlative-heavy cliché register; ChatGPT shows wider lexical variety but remains strongly promotional. Demographic analysis uncovers moderate gender gaps and extreme divergence for non-binary personas, tempered by a “protective” tendency to guide non-binary travellers toward countries with higher LGBTQI acceptance. Reinforcement bias is minimal, with over 90 percent of follow-up suggestions being novel in both systems. These results confirm that unconstrained LLMs are not neutral filters but active amplifiers of structural imbalances. The paper proposes a public-interest re-ranking layer, hosted by a body such as UN Tourism, that balances exposure fairness, seasonality smoothing, low-carbon routing, cultural congruence, safety safeguards and stereotype penalties, transforming conversational AI from an opaque gatekeeper into a sustainability-oriented travel recommendation tool.}

  abstract = {Mobile location data has emerged as a valuable data source for studying human mobility patterns in various contexts, including virus spreading, urban planning, and hazard evacuation. However, these data are often anonymized overviews derived from a panel of traced mobile devices, and the representativeness of these panels is not well documented. Without a clear understanding of the data representativeness, the interpretations of research based on mobile location data may be questionable. This article presents a comprehensive examination of the potential biases associated with mobile location data using SafeGraph Patterns data in the United States as a case study. The research rigorously scrutinizes and documents the bias from multiple dimensions, including spatial, temporal, urbanization, demographic, and socioeconomic, over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022 across diverse geographic levels, including state, county, census tract, and census block group. Our analysis of the SafeGraph Patterns dataset revealed an average sampling rate of 7.5\% with notable temporal dynamics, geographic disparities, and urban-rural differences. The number of sampled devices was strongly correlated with the census population at the county level over the five years for both urban (r {$>$} 0.97) and rural counties (r {$>$} 0.91), but less so at the census tract and block group levels. We observed minor sampling biases among groups such as gender, age, and moderate-income, with biases typically ranging from -0.05 to +0.05. However, minority groups such as Hispanic populations, low-income households, and individuals with low levels of education generally exhibited higher levels of underrepresentation bias that varied over space, time, urbanization, and across geographic levels. These findings provide important insights for future studies that utilize SafeGraph data or other mobile location datasets, highlighting the need to thoroughly evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bias across spatial scales when employing such data sources.}

  abstract = {This study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties. We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four different sources. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson’s r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The results suggest that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RIbetween their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.}

We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.}

However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. The summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at               https://github.com/jiawei-chen/RecDebiasing               .}

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.}

  abstract = {As firms are moving towards data-driven decision making, they are facing an emerging problem, namely, algorithmic bias. Accordingly, algorithmic systems can yield socially-biased outcomes, thereby compounding inequalities in the workplace and in society. This paper reviews, summarises, and synthesises the current literature related to algorithmic bias and makes recommendations for future information systems research. Our literature analysis shows that most studies have conceptually discussed the ethical, legal, and design implications of algorithmic bias, whereas only a limited number have empirically examined them. Moreover, the mechanisms through which technology-driven biases translate into decisions and behaviours have been largely overlooked. Based on the reviewed papers and drawing on theories such as the stimulus-organism-response theory and organisational justice theory, we identify and explicate eight important theoretical concepts and develop a research model depicting the relations between those concepts. The model proposes that algorithmic bias can affect fairness perceptions and technology-related behaviours such as machine-generated recommendation acceptance, algorithm appreciation, and system adoption. The model also proposes that contextual dimensions (i.e., individual, task, technology, organisational, and environmental) can influence the perceptual and behavioural manifestations of algorithmic bias. These propositions highlight the significant gap in the literature and provide a roadmap for future studies.}

In our research, we hypothesized that people who perform a (simulated) medical diagnostic task assisted by a biased AI system will reproduce the model's bias in their own decisions, even when they move to a context without AI support. In three experiments, participants completed a medical-themed classification task with or without the help of a biased AI system. The biased recommendations by the AI influenced participants' decisions. Moreover, when those participants, assisted by the AI, moved on to perform the task without assistance, they made the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase. Thus, participants' responses mimicked AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions. These results provide evidence of human inheritance of AI bias.}

  abstract = {The rapid development of AI tools and implementation of LLMs within downstream tasks has been paralleled by a surge in research exploring how the outputs of such AI/LLM systems embed biases, a research topic which was already being extensively explored before the era of ChatGPT. Given the high volume of research around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is imperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines within such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research covering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT, NeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of 189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human identity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was that 155/189 papers did not establish a working definition of 'bias' for their purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes exist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only mathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been published in the past 5 years, after literature reviews were published with a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how such researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical definitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias) within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus within the field on gender, race/ethnicity (57/189 papers), age (39/189 papers), religion (36/189 papers) and nationality (25/189 papers) bias, we document how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by overlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we advocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that while our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods across the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 20/189 papers include recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in real-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning academia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus contains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with recommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on diverse marginalized populations.}

Even when non-accuracy measures such as popularity bias, diversity, and novelty are studied, it is often solely from the users' perspective. However, many real-world recommenders are often multi-stakeholder environments in which the needs and interests of several stakeholders should be addressed in the recommendation process. In this paper, we focus on the popularity bias problem which is a well-known property of many recommendation algorithms where few popular items are over-recommended while the majority of other items do not get proportional attention and address its impact on different stakeholders. Using several recommendation algorithms and two publicly available datasets in music and movie domains, we empirically show the inherent popularity bias of the algorithms and how this bias impacts different stakeholders such as users and suppliers of the items. We also propose metrics to measure the exposure bias of recommendation algorithms from the perspective of different stakeholders.},

Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, defining distinct facets of harm and introducing several desiderata to operationalize fairness for LLMs. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies, two for bias evaluation, namely, metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation disambiguates the relationship between metrics and evaluation datasets, and organizes metrics by the different levels at which they operate in a model: embeddings, probabilities, and generated text. Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or prompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a consolidation of publicly available datasets for improved access. Our third taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their intervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing, with granular subcategories that elucidate research trends. Finally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work. Synthesizing a wide range of recent research, we aim to provide a clear guide of the existing literature that empowers researchers and practitioners to better understand and prevent the propagation of bias in LLMs.}

We put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs – by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls. Using this framework, we create OpinionQA, a dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs towards particular groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).},
