| Gini index across months           | How strong is demand seasonality across months?                                         |       $[0, 1]$       |     H1     |
| In-strength centralization         | How concentrated are tourist flows toward a specific destination?                       |       $[0, 1]$       |     H2     |
| Reciprocity                        | Are tourist flows between the two regions bidirectional?                                |       $[0, 1]$       |     H3     |
| Mean travel distance (km)          | On average, how far do people travel?                                                   |     $[0, 8278]$      |    H4a     |
| Ratio of flows to bordering states | What is the ratio of tourist flows between neighboring regions compared to total flows? |       $[0, 1]$       |    H5a     |

| Effect of shared border            | Do bordering regions have higher tourist flows between them?                            | $[- \infty, \infty]$ |    H5b     |
| Effect of self-loop                | Do intra-region tourist flows have a higher volume than inter-region flows?             | $[- \infty, \infty]$ |    H6b     |
