AI has become a catch-all term that encompasses various technologies aimed at simulating human intelligence. 
Adding to the confusion, tourism literature often discusses AI alongside other technologies like robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality [@gossling2025].
This study specifically focuses on generative AI and its implications for tourism. Trained to recognize patterns in vast data, these models can produce content such as text, images, or videos [see @epstein2023].
We avoid *chatbots* because they represent just one way generative AI is used.
Likewise, we do not use brand-specific terms like *ChatGPT* when discussing generative AI in general.

The adoption of generative AI in tourism industries sparked scholarly interest, prompting investigations into how they are used. Recent reviews by @gossling2025 and @li2025 summarize that studies primarily looked at who, when, and why tourists and practitioners adopt generative AI [e.g., @kim2025b; @xu2024].
In contrast, fewer studies provide evidence for projecting how generative AI will shift tourism's trajectory [@mellors2025].

One perspective is that generative AI brings benefits to tourists and businesses.
For example, generative AI reduces cognitive load during travel planning, thereby increasing visit intentions and decision satisfaction [@shin2025].
For businesses, @fan2025 show that AI-generated descriptions could boost revenue for underperforming short-term rentals.
However, generative AI adoption in tourism also raises concerns about its negative impacts.
@lehto2025 warned against “algorithmic flattening” that erases destination uniqueness.
Generative AI may undermine the sustainability of tourism by exacerbating over-tourism [@mellors2025].
Some conceptual works have examined both positive and negative aspects of generative AI adoption in tourism, concerning value co-creation and co-destruction [e.g., @dogru2025; @grundner2021].

The uncertainty surrounding generative AI’s impacts in tourism mirrors previous discussions about other technologies, such as search engines [@xiang2011; @gong2024a], social media [@leung2013], or smart technologies [@pan2021; @pergelova2026].
But generative AI’s uninterpretability further complicates assessing its impact on tourism.
As these models consist of billions of artificial neurons trained on vast data, understanding or predicting why a model produces a particular output becomes difficult [@mccoy2024].
Generative AI outputs depend heavily on user prompts as well [@yang2025].
These factors obfuscate the causality between generative AI adoption and changes in tourism patterns.
