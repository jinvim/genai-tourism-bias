A day would come when we no longer need to plan our trips.
Or at least, that is what companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic envision—easily "outsourcing” travel decisions to AI agents [@dawes2024].
From writing code to composing music, generative AI is transforming how we do many things [@marr2023].
Tourism is no exception in this regard.
The majority of travelers are already using generative AI to plan their trips [@booking.com2025].
In response, major online travel agencies like Expedia and TripAdvisor are integrating generative AI into their platforms [@tripadvisor2023;@expedia2023].

As tourism researchers, we pose a critical question: *What consequences await destinations if more tourists rely on generative AI to guide their travel decisions?*
Some tourism and hospitality experts warn that generative AI can suppress destinations’ uniqueness and undermine the sustainability of tourism [@dogru2025; @lehto2025].
Yet, we lack evidence to substantiate such concerns [@gossling2025; @mellors2025].
This knowledge gap leaves tourism destinations and businesses uncertain about how to prepare for generative AI's potential impacts, or to determine whether such preparation is even necessary.

In this study, we provide empirical insights into how this rapid adoption of generative AI may reshape tourism patterns.
We do so using scenario-based projections simulating decisions of one million US domestic tourists.
Scenarios include tourists making random choices, adhering to current patterns, and relying exclusively on large language models.
The last scenario offers a "worst-case" benchmark for assessing whether the concerns about generative AI's impacts are valid.

We show that compared to empirical-based simulations, large language models tend to concentrate visits during peak seasons and favor popular destinations.
Large language models also produce tourism patterns where popular states primarily receive tourists while reciprocating fewer.
However, these models show different tendencies regarding geographic patterns of tourist flows, like mean travel distance and preference for neighboring states and intra-state travel.
We conclude that generative AI has the potential to undermine the sustainability and resilience of the tourism sector.
While intuitive, this study offers valuable evidence quantifying how generative AI may reshape tourism patterns.
These findings show the need for tourism scholars and practitioners to assess and prepare for generative AI's impact on the tourism system.
