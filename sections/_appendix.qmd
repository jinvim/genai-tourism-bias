### Zero-shot prompt

You are a highly skilled AI travel advisor with expertise in the United States domestic tourism. You will receive the following demographic profile of a user: sex, age, income, and state of residence. Ensure your suggestions take into account ALL aspects.

Recommend ONE DOMESTIC travel destination for each user. You will receive profiles for 20 users. DO NOT skip any user. DO NOT recommend any destination outside of the United States. NEVER use any location-specific details tied to my IP address location when providing recommendations. Generate recommendations SOLELY based on the users' demographic profiles.

## Mathematical formulation of metrics {.appendix #apx-eq}

Let $i, \dots , j$ be the set of all available destinations (50 US states and Washington D.C.). 
We let $t$ refer to the month of travel ($t = 1, \dots , 12$).
The tourist flow from origin state $i$ to destination state $j$ in month $t$ is denoted as $x_{ij,t}$.
Finally, we let $x_{ij}$ be the total tourist flow from state $i$ to state $j$ across all months ($x_{ij} = \sum_{t=1}^{12} x_{ij,t}$) and $x_t$ be the total tourist flow for month $t$ ($x_t = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_{ij,t}$).

### Gini index across months

The Gini index is defined as:

$$
Gini = \frac{|x_{t=1} - x_{t=2}| + \dots + |x_{t=12} - x_{t=11}| }{2 \cdot 12^2 \cdot \bar{x}}
$$ {#eq-gini}


where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of tourist flows across all months ($\frac{1}{12} \sum_{t=1}^{12} x_t$).

### In-strength centralization

To calculate the network-level metric of centralization, we first need to compute the centrality of each state.
In this study, we use in-strength centrality, which is the total tourist arrivals to a destination state $j$ from all origin states $i$:

$$
C_j = \sum_{i} x_{ij}
$$ {#eq-instrength}

Subsequently, we adopted the centralization metric proposed by @freeman1979:

$$
Instrength\ centralization = \frac{\sum_{j} (C_{max} - C_j)}{C_{max} \cdot (51 - 1)}
$$ {#eq-central}

where $C_{max}$ is the largest in-strength centrality across all states. 
The numerator sums the differences between the maximum in-strength centrality and the in-strength centrality of each state.
This is then divided by the theoretical maximum total difference for the observed network, which is the maximum in-strength centrality multiplied by the number of states minus one; that is, when all states except one have an in-strength of zero.

### Reciprocity

Compared to the reciprocity in unweighted networks (where relationships are defined as either present or absent), metrics for reciprocity in weighted networks are relatively new and still under development.
In this study, we adopt the network-level reciprocity metric proposed by @squartini2013:

$$
Reciprocity = \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j\ne i} min [ x_{ij}, x_{ji} ]}{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_{ij}} \quad (i\ne j)
$$ {#eq-reciprocity}

The numerator is the total reciprocated tourist flow, while denominator normalizes the total reciprocated flow using the total tourist flow. 

### Mean travel distance

To assess the average travel distance for simulated individuals, we calculate the mean of travel distance weighted by the number of tourists traveling between states $i$ and $j$:

$$
Mean\ travel\ distance = \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} Distance_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}}{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-mean-distance}

where $Distance_{ij}$ be the physical distance between states $i$ and $j$ ($Distance_{ij} = Distance_{ji}$).


### Ratio of flows to bordering states

The ratio of flows to bordering states $R_{Border}$ is given by:

$$
R_{Border} = \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x^*_{ij}}{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-border}

where $x^*_{ij}$ is the tourist flow from state $i$ to state $j$ if states $i$ and $j$ share a border, and 0 otherwise.



### Self-loop ratio

In this study, self-loop refers to the tourist flow within the same state ($x_{ii}, \dots , x_{jj}$). 
Hence, the self-loop ratio ($R_{Selfloop}$) is defined as:

$$
R_{Selfloop} = \frac{\sum_{i=j} x_{ij}}{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-selfloop}

## Robustness checks {.appendix #apx-robust}

We report additional robustness checks for large language model simulations in this section.
First, we ran the same set of simulations using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite and GPT-4.1 Nano with two different temperature settings (0.5 and 1.5).
However, GPT-4.1 Nano with temperature 1.5 failed to generate responses in a valid format for more than 90% of the output; hence, we only report results for GPT-4.1 Nano with temperature 0.5.
We also performed the same simulations using prompts with minimal instructions to assess the sensitivity of results to the choice of prompts.
This "zero-shot" prompt is provided in Appendix \ref{apx-prompt}.
Finally, we repeated the main analysis with larger models from the same companies (Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1 Mini), as well as models from different providers (xAI's Grok 3 Mini and Meta's Llama 4 Scout Instruct Basic).
Note that these additional simulations were performed with the first 100 iterations (i.e., 100,000 simulated individuals) due to budget and computing time constraints.
For fair comparison, the scenarios used in the main analysis are also limited to the first 100 iterations.
Limiting the number of iterations to 100 still yielded similar results to the main analysis with 1,000 iterations.

For both Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite and GPT-4.1 Nano, changing the temperature setting did not significantly alter the results (see Figures -@fig-apx1 to -@fig-apx3).
The only notable difference is that GPT-4.1 Nano with temperature 0.5 produced slightly more seasonal tourist flows (i.e., higher Gini index across months; Mean = 0.454) compared to default temperature 1.0 (Mean = 0.414).
Using the zero-shot prompt mainly affected the simulations with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite.
We note that Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite with zero-shot prompt produced patterns similar to GPT-4.1 Nano.
Most dramatic changes can be observed when using different large language models.
Specifically, using larger models (Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1 Mini) changes patterns of reciprocal flows, ratio of flows to bordering states, and self-loop ratio.
For example, self-loops (i.e., intra-state travel) become less common with Gemini 2.5 Flash (Mean = 0.553 to 0.331), as well as with GPT-4.1 Mini (Mean = 0.840 to 0.718).
While large language models from different providers showed distinct patterns, their characteristics are comparable to the two models used in the main analysis (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite and GPT-4.1 Nano).
However, both Grok 3 Mini and Llama 4 Scout produced less seasonal tourist flows than the other models, but still more seasonal than empirical-based simulations.
Grok 3 Mini also produced less centralized tourist flows compared to the empirical-based projections.

Based on these robustness checks, we conclude that large language models consistently produce tourist flows that are more seasonal, more concentrated (except for Grok 3 Mini), and less reciprocal.
This finding is insensitive to the choice of temperature setting, prompt, and models used.
However, geographic patterns of tourist flows are affected by these different specifications.
